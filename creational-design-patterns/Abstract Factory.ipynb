    "1. **Encapsulation of object creation**: Abstract Factory Pattern encapsulates the object creation process, making it easier to change, maintain, or extend without affecting the client code.\n",
    "2. **Separation of concerns**: It separates the responsibility of creating objects from the client code, promoting a cleaner and more modular codebase.\n",
    "3. **Dependency inversion**: The pattern adheres to the dependency inversion principle by allowing the client code to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\n",
    "4. **Code flexibility**: It provides flexibility when adding new object types or variants, as you only need to modify or add factories, not the client code.\n",
    "5. **Consistency across platforms**: By using a factory for each platform or variant, the pattern ensures that the client code uses a consistent set of related objects, reducing the chance of mixing incompatible components."

    "#### Better Sides of Abstract Factory Pattern Over Factory Pattern\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Easier platform switching**: Abstract Factory Pattern makes it simpler to switch between different platforms or variants, since the client code can work with different concrete factories without changing the logic for creating and using objects.\n",
